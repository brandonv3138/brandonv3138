This week has been a fun and learning week, this week we've learned about video games. We played a game called Ninja Cat. It was simple and easy to cheat the game. 
We talked about what in the game changes like the Ninja Cat moves up, left and right. Later on in the week, we also talked about coordinates, and we did an activity
on whiteboards, where we had to copy the same location of a object.
