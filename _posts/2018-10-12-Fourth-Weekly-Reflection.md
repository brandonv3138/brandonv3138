Part 1:
  This week has been a creative and learning week, although we had 3 days of CS class, because of the 3 day weekend (Christopher Columbus day). During Tuesday, we were finishing our "flag project" art, it was the Canada flag. On Wednsday, we did a task that was about how program a square and a circle to be a image in WeScheme, we had to program the language by doing this, for example "(put-image (circle 25 "solid" "blue") 25 50 (square 50 50 "solid" "red"))", and when the language is ran, it produced a image with the shapes. I think there is some connection, the connection I see is that the "flag project" and this programming language can be connected by showing how can we make our flags with shapes and colors.
