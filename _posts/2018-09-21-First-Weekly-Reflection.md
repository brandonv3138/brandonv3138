Hi there, I'm Brandon, and today, I will reflect about Intro to CS. We've learned a lot of stuff, some of them that I didn't even knew.
Here is what I learned and what I struggled.

  What I've learned from class is how to make a website, it was easy with using with an website that developers uses, it's called "Github".
  I started to make my site by reading a tutorial and it was very easy. I learned what HTML and CSS's purpose. HTML makes the structure of the website and CSS does the decorations like customizing the font or background. and took notes, it was for a web quiz. After doing our basic website, Mr. Allatta added another tutorial, and it was to expand the site by adding a blog, it looked easy to make by reading instructions on the tutorial but actually, it was hard and complicated, it took me like a week to get the blog up and running, but I read all of my files and found the issue, I haven't looked at the code carefully and had mistakes.
