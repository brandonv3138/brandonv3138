So this week was very short because we went to an overnight trip and there isnt too much to over about.
This week was about programming shapes by using values and strings, and making them to be a image, for example "
put-image (circle size "type" "color") x y (square x y "type" "color"). We also added more shapes by adding 2 put images.
