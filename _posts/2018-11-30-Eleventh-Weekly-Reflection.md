I chose the question **#10** from the Midterm exam. 

What is this question asking.
It talks about what is the value of a expression, the expression is **(/ (+ (string-length "HelloWorld!") (+5 4)) 2)**.

Why the correct answer is correct.
The correct answer is "A", this is the correct answer because the string length of HelloWorld! is 11, and then you add 9 which is 20 (4 plus 5), then you divide it by 2 which gives you 10 or "A". 

Why "D" (None of the above) was the most chosen answer.
People chose "D" the most (or 69% who took the exam), this is probably because people aren't actually solving it correctly or randomly guessed it. This question was kinda easy but people who chose D probably didn't solve it correctly. This was also a practitioner question, so it might be another reason why it had a low proportion number.
