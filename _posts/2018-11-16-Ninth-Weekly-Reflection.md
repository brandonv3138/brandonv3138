This week was learning more about functions. As I remember, we had a activity on Thursday, it was about a rocket, me and my classmates had to write down in a whiteboard about what would it need for making it work. One answer from me was how would it look like by using put-image. Another thing was about defining. A example is ```(define orangecircle) (circle 20 "solid" "orange")``` This defines a orange circle, making a circle without taking too much time.
