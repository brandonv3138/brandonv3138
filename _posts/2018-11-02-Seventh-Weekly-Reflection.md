This week was all about making connections. We did defining strings, numbers and images, it was challenging at first, as I didn't fully get the concept. As I tried, I couldn't see the output until Mr. Allatta showed me how it worked on output, basically it was a simple progress. You must run the program with the defining then you must type the exact name that was defined into the output (for example FUN is being defined, in the output you must type the exact same thing.). For example (define greencircle (circle 50 "solid" "green"), you run the program then go to the output and type greencircle, and the green circle would appear. We also learned on how to use "bitmap/url", what it does is that it imports image files that supports png, jpeg/jpg, and gif and displays on the output. I conbined both define and bitmap, and it showed the image. I didn't actually expected to work.
